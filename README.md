In the project, we did the following:

- Data cleaning and processing
- Time series analysis
- Spatial analysis
- Analysis of Pedestrain fatal crashes

Repository layout:

- notebooks/: separate analysis notebook
- data/: raw data and cleaned data
- tools/: helper functions used by notebooks/scripts
- tools/tests/: pytest for these functions
- environment.yml: reproducible conda environment
- Makefile: one-command setup + automation
- results/: outcomes including png, html and csv files from analysis notebook; also used for direct display in main notebook
- Main.ipynb: main narrative notebook
- Readme: brief introduction and binder link
- LICENSE
- pdf_builds/: separate pdf files generated by MYST

Automation:

- make env: create conda environment

- make all: run all analysis notebooks


Testing: 
- run pytest to test functions in tools module
